PREFACE


The Old English _Physiologus_, or _Bestiary_, is a series of three brief
poems, dealing with the mythical traits of a land-animal, a sea-beast,
and a bird respectively, and deducing from them certain moral or
religious lessons. These three creatures are selected from a much larger
number treated in a work of the same name which was compiled at
Alexandria before 140 B.C., originally in Greek, and afterwards
translated into a variety of languages--into Latin before 431. The
standard form of the _Physiologus_ has 49 chapters, each dealing with a
separate animal (sometimes imaginary) or other natural object, beginning
with the lion, and ending with the ostrich; examples of these are the
pelican, the eagle, the phoenix, the ant (cf. Prov. 6.6), the fox, the
unicorn, and the salamander. In this standard text, the Old English
poems are represented by chapters 16, 17, and 18, dealing in succession
with the panther, a mythical sea-monster called the asp-turtle (usually
denominated the whale), and the partridge. Of these three poems, the
third is so fragmentary that little is left except eight lines of
religious application, and four of exhortation by the poet, so that the
outline of the poem, and especially the part descriptive of the
partridge, must be conjecturally restored by reference to the treatment
in the fuller versions, which are based upon Jer. 17.11 (the texts drawn
upon for the application in lines 5-11 are 2 Cor. 6.17,18; Isa. 55.7;
Heb. 2.10,11).

It has been said: 'With the exception of the Bible, there is perhaps no
other book in all literature that has been more widely current in every
cultivated tongue and among every class of people.' Such currency might
be illustrated from many English authors. Two passages from Elizabethan
literature may serve as specimens--the one from Spenser, the other from
Shakespeare. The former is from the _Faerie Queene_ (1. 11.34):

    At last she saw, where he upstarted brave
    Out of the well, wherein he drenched lay;
    As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean wave,
    Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray,
    And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay,
    Like Eyas hauke up mounts unto the skies,
    His newly budded pineons to assay,
    And marveiles at himselfe, still as he flies:
    So new this new-borne knight to battell new did rise.

The other is from _Hamlet_ (Laertes to the King):

    To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
    And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.[1]

However widely diffused, the symbolism exemplified by the _Physiologus_
is peculiarly at home in the East. Thus Egypt symbolized the sun, with
his death at night passing into a rebirth, by the phoenix, which, by a
natural extension, came to signify the resurrection. And the Bible not
only sends the sluggard to the ant, and bids men consider the lilies of
the field, but with a large sweep commands (Job 12.7,8): 'Ask now the
beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they
shall tell thee; or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the
fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.'

[Footnote 1: Alfred de Musset, in _La Nuit de Mai_, develops the image
of the pelican through nearly thirty lines.]

The text as here printed is extracted from my edition, _The Old English
Elenc, Phoenix, and Physiologus_ (Yale University Press, 1919), where a
critical apparatus may be found; here it may be sufficient to say that
Italic letters in square brackets denote my emendations, and Roman
letters those of previous editors. The translations have not hitherto
been published, and no complete ones are extant in any language, save
those contained in Thorpe's edition of the _Codex Exoniensis_, which
appeared in 1842. The long conjectural passage in the _Partridge_ is due
wholly to Mr. Pitman.

      Of living creatures many are the kinds
    Throughout the world--unnumbered, since no man
    Can count their multitudes, nor rightly learn
    The ways of their wild nature; wide they roam,
    These beasts and birds, as far as ocean sets
    A limit to the earth, embracing her
    And all her sunny fields with salty seas
    And toss of roaring billows.
                                 We have heard
    From men of wider lore of one wild beast,
    Wonderful dweller in a far-off land
    Renowned of men, who loves his native glens
    And dusky caverns. Him have wise men called

Many, yea numberless, are the tribes throughout the world whose natures
we can not rightly expound nor their multitudes reckon, so immense are
the swarms of birds and earth-treading animals wherever water, the
roaring ocean, the surge of salt billows, encompasses the smiling bosom
of earth.

We have heard about one marvelous kind of wild beast which inhabits, in
lands far off, a domain renowned among men, rejoicing there in his home
amid the mountain-caves. This beast is called panther, as the learned

    The panther, and in books have told of him,
    The solitary rover.
                        He is kind,
    A bounteous friend to every living thing
    Save one alone, the dragon; but with him
    The panther ever lives at enmity,
    Employing every means within his power
    To work him evil.
                      Fair is he, full bright
    And wonderful of hue. The holy scribes
    Tell us how Joseph's many-colored coat,
    Gleaming with varying dyes of every shade,
    Brilliant, resplendent, dazzled all men's eyes
    That looked upon it. So the panther's hues
    Shine altogether lovely, marvelous,
    While each fair color in its beauty glows
    Ever more rare and charming than the rest.
      His wondrous character is mild, and free

       *       *       *       *       *

among the children of men report in their books concerning that lonely
wanderer.

He is a friend, bountiful in kindness, to every one save only the
dragon; with him he always lives at enmity by means of every injury he
can inflict.

He is a bewitching animal, marvelously beautiful with every color. Just
as, according to men holy in spirit, Joseph's coat was variegated with
hues of every shade, each shining before the sons of men brighter and
more perfect than another, so does the color of this beast blaze with
every diversity, gleaming in wondrous wise so clear and fair that each
tint is ever lovelier than the next, glows more enchanting in its
splendor, more rare, more beauteous, and more strange.

He has a nature all his own, so gentle and so calm is

    From all disturbing passion. Gracious, kind,
    And full of love, he meditates no harm
    But to that venomous foe, as I have told,
    His ancient enemy.
                       Once he has rejoiced
    His heart with feasting, straight he finds a nook
    Hidden among dim caves, his resting-place.
    There three nights' space, in deepest slumber wrapped,
    The people's champion lies. Then, stout of heart,
    The third day he arises fresh from sleep,
    Endowed with glory. From the creature's mouth
    Issues a melody of sweetest strains;
    And close upon the voice a balmy scent
    Fills all the place--an incense lovelier,
    Sweeter, and abler to perfume the air,
    Than any odor of an earthly flower
    Or scent of woodland fruit, more excellent

       *       *       *       *       *

it. Kind, attractive, and friendly, he has no thought of doing harm to
any save the envenomed foe, his ancient adversary of whom I spoke.

When, delighting in a feast, he has partaken of food, ever at the end of
the meal he betakes himself to his resting-place, a hidden retreat among
the mountain-caves; there the champion of his race, overcome by sleep,
abandons himself to slumber for the space of three nights. Then the
dauntless one, replenished with vigor, straightway arises from sleep
when the third day has come. A melody, the most ravishing of strains,
flows from the wild beast's mouth; and, following the music, there
issues a fragrance from the place--a fume more transporting, sweet, and
strong than any odor whatever, than blossoms of plants or fruits of the
forest, choicer

    Than all this world's adornments. Then from town
    And palace, then from castle-hall, come forth
    Along the roads great troops of hurrying men--
    The very beasts come also; all press on
    Toward that sweet odor, when the voice is stilled.
      Such as this creature is the Lord our God,
    Giver of joys, to all creation kind,
    To men benignant, save alone to him,
    The dragon, author of all wickedness,
    Satan, the ancient adversary whom,
    Fettered with fire, shackled with dire constraint,
    Into the pit of torments God cast down.
    The third day Christ arose from out the grave,
    For three nights having suffered death for us,
    He, Lord of angels, he in whom alone
    Is hope of overcoming. Far and wide
    The tidings spread, like perfume fresh and sweet,
    Through all the world. Then to that fragrance thronged

       *       *       *       *       *

than aught that clothes the earth with beauty. Thereupon from cities,
courts, and castle-halls many companies of heroes flock along the
highways of earth; the wielders of the spear press forward in hurrying
throngs to that perfume--and so also do animals--when once the music has
ceased.

Even so the Lord God, the Giver of joy, is gracious to all creatures, to
every order of them, save only the dragon, the source of venom, that
ancient enemy whom he bound in the abyss of torments; shackling him with
fiery fetters, and loading him with dire constraints, he arose from
darkness on the third day after he, the Lord of angels, the Bestower of
victory, had for three nights endured death on our behalf. That was a
sweet perfume throughout the world, winsome and entrancing. Henceforth,

    Thus spoke the wise St. Paul: 'In all the world

    For our salvation with unstinting hand,
    Almighty Father, he, the only Hope
    Of all in heaven or here below on earth.'
    This is that noble fragrance, rare and sweet,
    Which draws all men to seek it from afar.

       *       *       *       *       *

through the whole extent of earth's regions, righteous men have streamed
in multitudes from every side to that fragrance. As said the wise St.
Paul: 'Manifold over the world are the lavish bounties which the Father
almighty, the Hope of all creatures above and below, bestows on us as
grace and salvation.' That, too, is a sweet odor.

      Now will I spur again my wit, and use
    Poetic skill to weave words into song,
    Telling of one among the race of fish,
    The great asp-turtle. Men who sail the sea
    Often unwillingly encounter him,
    Dread preyer on mankind. His name we know,
    The ocean-swimmer, Fastitocalon.
      Dun, like rough stone in color, as he floats
    He seems a heaving bank of reedy grass
    Along the shore, with rolling dunes behind,
    So that sea-wanderers deem their gaze has found
    An island. Boldly then their high-prowed ships
    They moor with cables to that shore, a land
    That is no land. Still floating on the waves,
    Their ocean-coursers curvet at the marge;

       *       *       *       *       *

This time I will with poetic art rehearse, by means of words and wit, a
poem about a kind of fish, the great sea-monster which is often
unwillingly met, terrible and cruel-hearted to seafarers, yea, to every
man; this swimmer of the ocean-streams is known as the asp-turtle.

His appearance is like that of a rough boulder, as if there were tossing
by the shore a great ocean-reedbank begirt with sand-dunes, so that
seamen imagine they are gazing upon an island, and moor their
high-prowed ships with cables to that false land, make fast the
ocean-coursers at the sea's end, and, bold of heart, climb up

    The weary-hearted sailors mount the isle,
    And, free from thought of peril, there abide.
      Elated, on the sands they build a fire,
    A mounting blaze. There, light of heart, they sit--
    No more discouraged--eager for sweet rest.
    Then when the crafty fiend perceives that men,
    Encamped upon him, making their abode,
    Enjoy the gentle weather, suddenly
    Under the salty waves he plunges down,
    Straight to the bottom deep he drags his prey;
    He, guest of ocean, in his watery haunts
    Drowns ships and men, and fast imprisons them
    Within the halls of death.
                               Such is the way
    Of demons, devils' wiles: to hide their power,
    And stealthily inveigle heedless men,
    Inciting them against all worthy deeds,
    And luring them to seek for help and comfort

       *       *       *       *       *

on that island; the vessels stand by the beach, enringed by the flood.
The weary-hearted sailors then encamp, dreaming not of peril.

On the island they start a fire, kindle a mounting flame. The dispirited
heroes, eager for repose, are flushed with joy. Now when the cunning
plotter feels that the seamen are firmly established upon him, and have
settled down to enjoy the weather, the guest of ocean sinks without
warning into the salt wave with his prey (?), and makes for the bottom,
thus whelming ships and men in that abode of death.

Such is the way of demons, the wont of devils: they spend their lives in
outwitting men by their secret power, inciting them to the corruption of
good deeds, misguiding

    From unsuspected foes, until at last
    They choose a dwelling with the faithless one.
    Then, when the fiend, by crafty malice stirred,
    From where hell's torments bind him fast, perceives
    That men are firmly set in his domain,
    With treachery unspeakable he hastes
    To snare and to destroy the lives of those,
    Both proud and lowly, who in sin perform
    His will on earth. Donning the mystic helm
    Of darkness, with his prey he speeds to hell,
    The place devoid of good--all misty gloom,
    Where broods a sullen lake, black, bottomless,
    Just as the monster, Fastitocalon,
    Destroys seafarers, overwhelming men
    And staunch-built ships.
                             Another trait he has,
    This proud sea-swimmer, still more marvelous.
    When hunger grips the monster on the deep,
    Making him long for food, his gaping mouth
    The ocean-warder opens, stretching wide

       *       *       *       *       *

them at will so that they seek help and support from fiends, until they
end by making their fixed abode with the betrayer. When, from out his
living torture, the crafty, malicious enemy perceives that any one is
firmly settled within his domain, he proceeds, by his malignant wiles,
to become the slayer of that man, be he rich or poor, who sinfully does
his will; and, covered by his cap of darkness, suddenly betakes himself
with them to hell, where naught of good is found, a bottomless abyss
shrouded in misty gloom--like that monster which engulfs the
ocean-traversing men and ships.

This proud tosser of the waves has another and still more wonderful
trait. When hunger plagues him on the deep, and the monster longs for
food, this haunter of the sea opens his mouth, and sets his lips agape;

    His monstrous lips; and from his cavernous maw
    Sends an entrancing odor. This sweet scent,
    Deceiving other fishes, lures them on
    In swiftly moving schools toward that fell place
    Whence comes the perfume. There, unwary host,
    They enter in, until the yawning mouth
    Is filled to overflowing, when, at once,
    Trapping their prey, the fearful jaws snap shut.
      So, in this fleeting earthly time, each man
    Who orders heedlessly his mortal life
    Lets a sweet odor, some beguiling wish,
    Entice him, so that in the eyes of God,
    The King of glory, his iniquities
    Make him abhorrent. After death for him
    The all-accursed devil opens hell--
    Opens for all who in their folly here
    Let pleasures of the body overcome
    Their spirits' guidance. When the wily fiend

whereupon there issues a ravishing perfume from his inwards, by which
other kinds of fish are beguiled. With lively motions they swim to where
the sweet odor comes forth, and there enter in, a heedless host, until
the wide gorge is full; then, in one instant, he snaps his fierce jaws
together about the swarming prey.

Thus it is with any one who, in this fleeting time, full oft neglects to
take heed to his life, and allows himself to be enticed by sweet
fragrance, a lying lure, so that he becomes hostile to the King of glory
by reason of his sins. The accursed one will, when they die, throw wide
the doors of hell to those who, in their folly, have wrought the
treacherous delights of the body, contrary to the wise guidance of the
soul. When the deceiver, skilful in wrongdoing, hath brought into that
fastness,

    And praise his glory everlastingly.

such as had eagerly followed his teachings in the days of their life, he
then, after their death, snaps tight together his fierce jaws, the gates
of hell. They who enter there have neither relief nor escape, no means
of flight, any more than the fishes that swim the sea can escape from
the clutch of the monster.

Therefore is it by all means [best for every one of us to serve[1]] the
Lord of lords, and strive against devils with words and works, that so
we may come to behold the King of glory. Let us ever, now in this
fleeting time, seek from him grace and salvation, that so with the
Beloved we may in worship enjoy the bliss of heaven for evermore.

[Footnote 1: The partridge (like the cuckoo) broods the eggs of other
birds. When they are hatched and grown, they fly off to their true
parents. So men may turn from the devil, who has wrongfully gained
possession of them, to their heavenly Father, who will receive them as
his children.]

      About another creature have I heard
    A wondrous [tale.] [There is] a bird [men call
    The partridge. Strange is she, unlike all birds
    In field or wood who brood upon their eggs,
    Hatching their young. The partridge lays no eggs,
    Nor builds a dwelling; but instead, she steals
    The well-wrought nests of others. There she sits,
    Warming a stranger brood, until at last
    The eggs are hatched. But when the stolen chicks
    Are fledged, they straightway fly away to seek
    Their proper kin, and leave the partridge there
    Forsaken. In such wise the devil works
    To steal the souls of those whose youthful minds
    Or foolish hearts in vain resist his wiles.
    But when they reach maturer age, they see
    They are true children of the Lord of lords.
    Then they desert the lying fiend, and seek
    Their rightful Father, who with open arms
    Receives them, as he long since promised them.[1]]
      Fair is that word the Lord of glory spoke:
    'In such time as you turn with faithful hearts
    To me, and put away your hellish sins,
    Abominable to me, then will I turn
    To you in love for ever, for my heart
    Is mild and gracious. Thenceforth you shall be

hell, I will turn straightway to you with love, in the gentleness of my

excellent beyond compare. Finit.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
